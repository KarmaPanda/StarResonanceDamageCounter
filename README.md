A real-time combat data statistics tool for the "Blue Protocol: Star Resonance" game, which analyzes combat data in real-time through network packet capture technology, providing damage statistics, DPS calculations, and other features.

The accuracy of this tool has been verified through multiple actual combat tests, and no data loss issues have been found under stable network conditions.

This tool does not require modification of the game client and does not violate the game's terms of service. The tool aims to help players better understand combat data, reduce ineffective improvements, and enhance gaming experience. Before using this tool, please ensure that the data results will not be used for combat power discrimination or other behaviors that damage the game community environment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### One-Click Usage

Go to [Release page](https://github.com/KarmaPanda/StarResonanceDamageCounter/releases) to download the release version.

### Manual Compilation

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22.15.0
- **pnpm** >= 10.13.1
- **WinPcap/Npcap** (Network packet capture driver)
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (Compilation dependency)
  - Can be installed through [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
  - Select "C++ build tools" workload
- **Python** 3.10 (Compilation dependency)
  - Can be downloaded and installed from [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Ensure Python is added to system PATH

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter.git
   cd StarResonanceDamageCounter
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Install WinPcap/Npcap**
   - Download and install [Npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/) or [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/) (Npcap recommended)
   - Ensure "WinPcap API-compatible mode" is selected during installation

4. **Run**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   After running, you will be prompted to:
   - Select the network device for packet capture (you can check network adapter information through Control Panel)
   - Select log level (`info`: basic information, `debug`: detailed logs)

   You can also specify directly through command line parameters:

   ```bash
   node server.js <device_number> <log_level>
   ```

   Or use auto-detection mode (recommended):

   ```bash
   node server.js auto info
   ```

   Auto-detection mode will:
   - Intelligently identify physical network adapters, excluding virtual adapters (such as ZeroTier, VMware, etc.)
   - Analyze network traffic for 3 seconds and automatically select the most active adapter
   - Fall back to routing table method when no traffic is detected

   Manual specification example:

   ```bash
   node server.js 4 info
   ```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Select Network Device**
   - After starting the program, a list of available network devices will be displayed
   - Enter the corresponding device number shown in the program output list (usually select the main network adapter)
   - You can check the network adapter information through Control Panel or system settings

2. **Set Log Level**
   - Choose log level: `info` or `debug`
   - Recommended to use `info` level to reduce log output

3. **Start Game**
   - The program will automatically detect game server connections
   - When a game server is detected, server information will be output and data statistics will begin

4. **View Data**
   - Open browser and visit: `http://localhost:8989`
   - View real-time combat data statistics

## üì± Web Interface Features

- **Instantaneous DPS/HPS** - Current second's damage/healing output
- **Maximum Instantaneous** - Historical highest instantaneous output record
- **Total DPS/HPS** - Overall average output efficiency

### Operation Features

- **Clear Data** - Reset all statistical data
- **Theme Switch** - Switch between day/night modes
- **Auto Refresh** - Automatically update data every 100ms

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot detect game server**
   - Check if network device selection is correct
   - Confirm the game is running and connected to server
   - Try going to less crowded areas on the same map

2. **Web interface cannot be accessed**
   - Check if port 8989 is occupied
   - Confirm firewall settings allow local connections

3. **Data statistics abnormal**
   - Check log output for error messages
   - Try restarting the program to recapture

4. **cap module compilation error**
   - Ensure Visual Studio Build Tools and Python are installed
   - Confirm Node.js version meets requirements

5. **Program exits immediately after startup**
   - Ensure Npcap is installed
   - Confirm network device selection entered correct number
